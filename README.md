# ExpEval
 This repo is meant to be entry-level practice of arithmetic expression evaluation. 
 
 The `remove_spaces` function in [eval.h](https://github.com/genxium/ExpEval/blob/master/eval.h) and [eval.cpp](https://github.com/genxium/ExpEval/blob/master/eval.cpp) is specific to this repository and NOT for general purpose tokenizing.
 
 There's another repository created to present a [simple tokenizer](https://github.com/genxium/SimpleTokenizer).
